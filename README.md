Projects contains:

1. Boston Housing Prediction

Model Tuning | Metric Performance| Statistical Analysis| bias/underfitting & variance/overfitting| Cross Validation | Model Complexity |Learning Curves
Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

2. Finding Donors for Charity ML

Decision TreesRegression vs Classification type problems | sklearn |Adaboosting | K-Nearest NeighborsNaive | Bayes | Support Vector Machines | Neural Networks | Regression | Model Fitting and Prediction
Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

3. Dog Breed Classifier

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks | Transfer Learning | Deep Convolutional Neural Networks | Transfer Learning
Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.

4. Douban Movie Website crawler

Website Crawler | HTML | BeautifulSoup | Python | Data Analysis | Data Processing
Develop an website crawler using python with BeautifulSoup library. The algroithm can detect the button class containing in the HTML and can turn on webpages automatically as the parameter set. Collected data will be used to do descriptive analysis.
